Python based medical device simulator helper programs.
Written by John Trimis.

This should allow you to simulate ether an HL7 connection (ADT/Results/etc.) or an ASTM 1394/1386 connection (serially connected medical device).

I made these because I needed something to quickly throw together to test out some interfaces.  They are by no means complete, and are just complex enough to be functional. A true implementation of either protocol would be a massive undertaking.  These just connect to an IP and Port and provide framing and control characters.


See the ADTSimulator.py for how to use HL7.py

See GenericASTM.py for how to use ATM1394.py
