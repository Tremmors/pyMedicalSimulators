Python based medical device simulator helper programs.
Written by John Trimis.

This should allow you to simulate ether an HL7 connection (ADT/Results/etc.) or an ASTM 1394/1386 connection (serially connected medical device).

See the ADTSimulator.py for how to use HL7.py
See GenericASTM.py for how to use ATM1394.py
